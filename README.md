Resume for Fares Abdelhamed

Hello! Welcome to my Resume Page!
I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to visit my page.

Attached are six different projects I've worked on over my school year.

(JAVA)
The first is a Number Guessing Game I made during my first year with a classmate using Java!
The concept is simple, you will be given an minimum number and maximum number, and you will need to guess the number.
Each time you guess a number, you will be told whether or not the correct number is higher or lower.
You are congratulated for guessing the number within three attempts, but if not you will simply be told how many attempts it took you to win.
To run the game, run the Game.java file in any cmd prompt on Windows.

(JAVA)
The second is a Zombie Apocalypse game made using Java during my first year.
Upon start, zombies will spawn in randomized locations and you will need to defeat them all for the helicopter to spawn.
You will have a revolver to be able to shoot, and can reload it. When the helicopter spawns, make your way over and you clear the game!
Left clicking will shoot the revolver, and pressing R will reload the revolver.
To run the game, run the Game.java file in any cmd prompt on Windows.

(GAMEMAKER Lang)
The third is a very mini project called 'SBM Prototype' that is essentially like Rock-Paper-Scissors. 
There is a readMe attached with instructions on keybinds and how to play, but it is essentially a fantasy card version of RPS.

(GAMEMAKER Lang)
The fourth is a GameMaker 2D Game project called 'Memory Tree' made during my third year.
To see instructions and keybinds, you can read the attached readMe, but it works as follows.
You spawn in, and have two abilities, in which you can shoot a fireball or breathe fire. 
There is a rune in the middle that is deactivated, but once you have defeated all of the monsters in the room, it activates.
Upon stepping on the rune, the game restarts but you keep your experience and levels you gained from the previous room.
Levels will increase certain resource amounts as well as increase the amount of damage you deal.
All sprites are drawn by me.

(UNITY C# 3D)
The fifth is a Unity 3D Game project made during my third year.
Similar to the GameMaker game, you spawn in and must defeat skeletons to restart the level.
Every time you restart the level, more skeletons will spawn in for you to defeat.
There are multiple movement mechanics involved within this game.

The final project is a team-developed project by me and three others using the Scrum Agile Development Methodology.
It is a dungeon crawler game in which you are able to switch between three characters, a knight mage and archer. 
Each of these characters have their indiviudal abilities and health, but they share a mana pool. When all characters are dead or enemies have been defeated, the game will end.
